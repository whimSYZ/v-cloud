# v-cloud
 A volumetric cloud render based on OpenGL.
Implementing:
 - Preetham model to render the sun and sky
 - Pre-computed Perlin-worley noise to calculate cloud density
 - Simplex 3D noise to calculate curl
 - Ray marching to calculate cloud lighting 

## Compile
Compile and build using `CMake`. Configure using IDE or build with command line
> `cmake --build build --config Release --target all -j 12 `

## Instructions

| Key | Operation |
| -------- | ------- |
| Drag mouse | Tilt camera |
| W | Forward |
| A | Backward |
| S | Left |
| D | Right |
| Q | Up |
| Z | Down |
| &uarr; | Rise sun |
| &uarr; | Fall sun |
| &larr; | Decrease coverage (less rain cloud) |
| &rarr; | Increase coverage (more rain cloud) |

Frame rate is outputed to `stdout` per 5s.

Please don't go above the clouds, below the surface, or outside of radius as it triggers bugs!

## Objectives 

- [x] Sample Perlin-Worley noise to create cloud models. (See [perlinworley.h](src/perlinworley.h))
- [x] Calculate light intensity going through clounds based on Beer-Lambert law. (Line 271 in [sky.frag](shaders/sky.frag#217))
- [x] Account for scattering. (Line 265 in [sky.frag](/shaders/sky.frag#265))
- [x] Account for absorption. (Line 279 in [sky.frag](shaders/sky.frag#279))
- [x] Calculate sky color in four discrete times of a day: sunrise, noon, sunset and night, using Preetham model. (Line 55 in [sky.frag](shaders/sky.frag#55))
- [x] Use ray marching to render clouds. (Line 242 in [sky.frag](shaders/sky.frag#242))
- [x] FPS â‰¥ 3. (See `stdout`)
- [x] Use a user-interface to determine rain cloud density. (See above)

## Dependancies
- C++ 20
